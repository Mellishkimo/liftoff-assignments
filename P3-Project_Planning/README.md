## Submission Instructions

### Wireframes

I uploaded the wireframes, they should be attached above the text area.

### Project Tracker
Admittedly I'm in the process of transitioning from using Trello to using Github for my user stories, so I have not updated my Trello since week 1. This is the link for now. Next week I should have everything centralized and organized on Github.

### Project Repo Link

My project repo is kind of a desert wasteland at the moment. Hoping to get some heavy lifting done on the actual coding end this weekend. I spent more time than I expected on my wireframes, but I think that will ultimately save me time down the road since I realized there were important features and aspects of the site layout that I hadn't previously accounted for.
