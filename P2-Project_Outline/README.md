# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is a web application tentatively titled Lightning Fast Horror Reviews. The concept for the application was inspired by society’s shift away from the structured TV schedules found on cable and towards the overwhelming options offered by streaming services. Oftentimes the process of deciding on a movie or show to watch can take upwards of 10 or 15 minutes, and it can be difficult to find quick, easy, satisfactory information on the options available. Lightning Fast Horror Reviews offers a niche service to fans of horror films so that they can effortlessly and efficiently access the data most pertinent to them while perusing movie selections.

Reviews on LFHR consist of five categories: Character, Plot, Aesthetic/Atmosphere, Antagonist, and Graphic Content, all rated on a scale of 1-10. Reviewers may optionally give a brief comment on the rating assigned to each category, using no more than 140 characters to do so. The concise nature of LFHR reviews allow users to get an instant snapshot of the experience offered by a film, without reading lengthy critiques or watching trailers that often contain unintentional spoilers. Perhaps even more importantly, users can sort movies in the LFHR database so that they can see which films have the highest Plot rating, or most entertaining Characters. No matter what experience you desire from your film for the evening, LFHR will help you find it in the shortest time possible!

### Features
1. Review Submission- Users will be able to submit their own reviews for the website.
2. Movie Submission- As of now, I am not planning to merge LFHR with another database, which means that all films will be added to the prototype application manually. If a user wishes to add a movie not yet in the database, they may do so.
3. Category sorting- Users will be able to sort all movies in the database by highest and lowest rating for any of the five categories, allowing them to see the best and worst films available.
4. Score aggregation- All scores submitted by users for each category of a film will be added to the aggregate score for that film. This will allow users to see the average ‘Plot’ rating given for a film, both on the review page for the film, and on the master list of films. 

### Technologies (currently planned, at least)
Java
Springboot
Thymeleaf
MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
At a minimum I plan to learn more about front-end interactivity and improving the visual presentation of my web applications. If I have enough time, I also want to incorporate user authentication so that a user would be able to see all the reviews submitted by a particular user.
